# H1A1-update

The university has the following rules for grading:
->Each student gets a grade between 0 and 100.
->A grade less than 40 is an insufficient grade.

The professor rounds the grade using the following rules:
->If the difference between the grade and the next multiple (multiples) of 5 is less than 3, the grade is rounded up to the next multiple (multiples) of 5.
->If the grade is less than 38, the grade is not rounded up. e.g. 84 => 8529 => 29
